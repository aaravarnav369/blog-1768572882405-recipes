        <p>There are few dishes that hug your soul quite like a generous bowl of Chicken Cheese Pasta. It's a timeless classic, a dish that transcends generations and taste preferences, bringing warmth and satisfaction with every forkful. Imagine tender pieces of seasoned chicken, perfectly cooked pasta, all swimming in a velvety, rich cheese sauce – it's pure culinary bliss. This isn't just a recipe; it's an invitation to create a masterpiece of comfort in your own kitchen that will have everyone asking for seconds.</p><p>The magic truly begins with the chicken. For this recipe, we recommend using boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces. Season them generously with salt, black pepper, and a touch of Italian seasoning before searing them to a beautiful golden brown. This crucial step not only cooks the chicken but also builds a flavorful foundation for our sauce. Don't rush it; those little browned bits, known as 'fond,' are packed with flavor that will elevate your entire dish.</p><p>Now, let's talk cheese – the heart and soul of our pasta. We're not holding back here! A combination of sharp cheddar for tang, creamy mozzarella for that irresistible stretch, and a finishing sprinkle of nutty Parmesan creates a complex, indulgent flavor profile. The sauce itself starts with a classic béchamel base, made with butter, flour, and milk, ensuring a smooth, lump-free consistency. Gradually melting in your chosen cheeses transforms this simple sauce into a luxurious, glossy coating for our pasta and chicken.</p><p>Choosing the right pasta shape is key to ensuring every bite is perfectly coated in that glorious sauce. Penne, rotini, fusilli, or even shells work wonderfully, as their nooks and crannies are ideal for capturing the creamy goodness. Cook your pasta al dente according to package directions; it's vital to avoid overcooking, as it will continue to cook slightly when combined with the hot sauce. A firm, chewy texture is what we're aiming for, providing a delightful contrast to the tender chicken and smooth sauce.</p><p>Bringing it all together is the most satisfying part. Once your chicken is cooked and your cheese sauce is ready, simply drain your al dente pasta and add it directly to the sauce pan along with the cooked chicken. Gently toss everything until every piece of pasta and chicken is lovingly coated. At this stage, you can also add a handful of fresh spinach for a touch of greens, or some sun-dried tomatoes for an extra layer of savory depth. A little reserved pasta water can be added if the sauce feels too thick, helping it cling beautifully.</p><p>Serve your Creamy Chicken Cheese Pasta immediately, garnished with a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley and perhaps a pinch of red pepper flakes for a subtle kick. It’s a complete meal on its own, but pairs wonderfully with a simple green salad or some crusty garlic bread to sop up any leftover sauce. This dish is fantastic for a busy weeknight, yet decadent enough to impress guests. Leftovers, if there are any, can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and reheated gently.</p><h3>Ingredients</h3><ul><li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces</li><li>1 tbsp olive oil</li><li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li><li>1/2 tsp salt, plus more to taste</li><li>1/4 tsp black pepper, plus more to taste</li><li>1 lb pasta (penne, rotini, or fusilli recommended)</li><li>4 tbsp unsalted butter</li><li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li><li>3 cups whole milk, warmed</li><li>1 cup chicken broth</li><li>2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li><li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li><li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish</li><li>1/4 tsp garlic powder (optional)</li><li>Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional)</li><li>Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish</li></ul><h3>Instructions</h3><ol><li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining. Set aside.</li><li>While pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add chicken pieces, season with Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li><li>In the same skillet (do not clean), melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, to create a roux.</li><li>Gradually whisk in the warm milk and chicken broth until smooth. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens, about 5-7 minutes.</li><li>Reduce heat to low. Stir in the shredded cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese, and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese until completely melted and smooth. Season with garlic powder (if using), additional salt, and pepper to taste. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water until desired consistency is reached.</li><li>Add the cooked chicken and drained pasta to the cheese sauce. Toss gently until everything is evenly coated. If adding, stir in fresh spinach or sun-dried tomatoes at this stage.</li><li>Serve immediately, garnished with fresh chopped parsley and a sprinkle of extra Parmesan cheese or red pepper flakes, if desired.</li></ol></div>
