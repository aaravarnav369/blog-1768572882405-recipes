        <p>There are few dishes as universally beloved and satisfying as a well-made plate of fried rice. It's the ultimate comfort food, a delightful medley of textures and flavors that can transform humble leftovers into a culinary masterpiece. Our Chicken Egg Fried Rice recipe takes this classic to new heights, combining tender chicken, fluffy scrambled eggs, and perfectly seasoned rice into a dish that's far superior to any takeout, and incredibly rewarding to make yourself.</p><p>The secret to truly great fried rice starts with the rice itself. Day-old, chilled cooked rice is non-negotiable. Freshly cooked rice is too moist and will lead to a clumpy, mushy mess. Using cold, firm rice ensures each grain separates beautifully, allowing it to soak up all the delicious sauces and aromatics without becoming soggy. Opt for a medium-grain or long-grain white rice like jasmine for the best results – its slight stickiness holds just enough, while still allowing for individual grains.</p><p>Beyond the rice, the magic of fried rice lies in its layered flavors. We begin by searing the chicken until golden and flavorful, creating a foundation of savory goodness. Next, the eggs are quickly scrambled and removed, ready to be incorporated back in later, adding both richness and a beautiful texture. The aromatics – garlic, ginger, and spring onions – are crucial, blooming in hot oil to infuse the entire dish with their fragrant essence, setting the stage for the final symphony of tastes.</p><p>Achieving that coveted 'wok hei' or 'breath of the wok' at home is easier than you think. The key is high heat and proper technique. Ensure your wok or large skillet is screaming hot before adding oil and ingredients. Cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding, which lowers the temperature and steams the food instead of frying it. Keep everything moving – a constant stir and toss ensures even cooking, prevents sticking, and develops those irresistible caramelized bits that define a great fried rice.</p><p>No fried rice is complete without a perfectly balanced sauce. Our blend typically includes soy sauce for umami and color, a touch of oyster sauce (optional, but highly recommended) for depth and sweetness, a dash of sesame oil for its distinctive nutty aroma, and a pinch of white pepper. This combination coats every grain of rice and piece of chicken, creating a harmonious flavor profile that is both savory and slightly sweet, with just enough tang to keep you coming back for more.</p><p>While our recipe offers a classic take, fried rice is incredibly versatile. Feel free to add your favorite vegetables like peas, carrots, or corn. For an extra kick, a touch of chili oil or Sriracha can be added at the end. Serve your freshly made Chicken Egg Fried Rice immediately as a standalone meal or as a fantastic side dish to other Asian-inspired entrees. Garnish with fresh chopped spring onions for a burst of color and freshness.</p><h3>Ingredients</h3><ul><li>2 cups cooked jasmine rice (day-old, chilled)</li><li>1 boneless, skinless chicken breast or thigh, cut into small cubes</li><li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li><li>1 tbsp soy sauce (for chicken marinade)</li><li>2 tbsp vegetable oil (or other high smoke point oil), divided</li><li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>1 inch ginger, grated or minced</li><li>1/2 cup chopped yellow onion or shallots</li><li>1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots blend (optional)</li><li>2 tbsp soy sauce (for fried rice)</li><li>1 tbsp oyster sauce (optional, but recommended)</li><li>1 tsp sesame oil</li><li>1/2 tsp white pepper</li><li>2 spring onions, chopped (white and green parts separated)</li><li>Salt to taste</li></ul><h3>Instructions</h3><ol><li>Prepare Chicken & Eggs: In a small bowl, marinate chicken cubes with 1 tbsp soy sauce. Set aside for 10-15 minutes. Lightly beat eggs in another small bowl with a pinch of salt.</li><li>Scramble Eggs: Heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in beaten eggs and scramble until just set but still slightly moist. Remove eggs from the wok and set aside.</li><li>Cook Chicken: Add the remaining 1 tbsp vegetable oil to the hot wok. Add the marinated chicken and stir-fry until cooked through and lightly browned, about 3-4 minutes. Remove chicken from the wok and set aside with the eggs.</li><li>Sauté Aromatics & Vegetables: Add a little more oil if needed. Add minced garlic, ginger, and the white parts of the spring onions. Stir-fry for 30 seconds until fragrant. If using, add frozen peas and carrots blend and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes.</li><li>Add Rice & Sauce: Add the day-old cooked rice to the wok. Break up any clumps with your spatula. Pour in the 2 tbsp soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), and white pepper. Stir-fry vigorously, tossing and folding the rice until well combined and heated through, about 3-5 minutes.</li><li>Combine & Serve: Return the cooked chicken and scrambled eggs to the wok. Toss everything together for another 1-2 minutes until thoroughly mixed and heated. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt or soy sauce if needed.</li><li>Garnish & Enjoy: Remove from heat. Stir in the green parts of the spring onions. Serve hot immediately, garnished with extra spring onions if desired.</li></ol></div>
