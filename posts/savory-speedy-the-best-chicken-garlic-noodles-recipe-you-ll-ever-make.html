        <p>There's something incredibly comforting and satisfying about a steaming bowl of noodles, isn't there? And when those noodles are tossed with tender, savory chicken and infused with an abundance of fragrant garlic, you've hit culinary gold. Our Chicken Garlic Noodles recipe isn't just another weeknight meal; it's a vibrant, flavor-packed experience that brings the best of your favorite Asian take-out right into your kitchen, but even better, and incredibly quick to prepare.</p><p>What makes these Chicken Garlic Noodles truly stand out is the symphony of flavors. We're talking serious garlic power, perfectly balanced with the deep, savory notes of soy and oyster sauce, a touch of sweetness to round it all out, and the subtle nuttiness of sesame oil. Each strand of noodle acts as a perfect vehicle for this irresistible sauce, while juicy, marinated chicken pieces add a hearty, satisfying element to every bite. It’s a harmonious blend that tantalizes the taste buds without being overly complicated.</p><p>While the magic truly happens in the sauce, the foundation of this dish lies in quality ingredients and a few smart techniques. Opt for boneless, skinless chicken thighs for maximum juiciness, or chicken breast if you prefer a leaner cut. The type of noodle is flexible – egg noodles, ramen noodles, or even spaghetti can work wonders. The key to success is prepping your ingredients ahead of time, ensuring a smooth and rapid cooking process. A generous amount of fresh garlic is non-negotiable – remember, it's called 'Chicken Garlic Noodles' for a reason!</p><p>Don't let the incredible flavor fool you; assembling these Chicken Garlic Noodles is remarkably straightforward. We'll start by quickly marinating the chicken to lock in flavor and tenderness, then sear it to golden perfection. While your chosen noodles cook, a simple yet potent sauce comes together in minutes. The grand finale involves tossing everything together in a wok or large skillet, allowing the noodles to absorb all that delicious, garlicky goodness. It's a dance of quick steps that results in a magnificent dish, making it perfect for busy weeknights when you crave something extraordinary.</p><p>One of the joys of cooking is making a recipe your own. Feel free to add extra vegetables like bell peppers, snap peas, or carrots for added color and nutrition. A sprinkle of red pepper flakes can kick up the heat, or a squeeze of lime can add a bright finish. Serve these Chicken Garlic Noodles hot, garnished with fresh chopped green onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds, for a dish that’s not only delicious but also visually appealing. Get ready to impress your family and friends with this undoubtedly addictive recipe!</p><h3>Ingredients</h3><ul><li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces</li><li>1 tbsp soy sauce (for chicken marinade)</li><li>1 tsp cornstarch (for chicken marinade)</li><li>8 oz egg noodles or ramen noodles</li><li>1/4 cup neutral oil (vegetable, canola, or grapeseed)</li><li>8-10 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce</li><li>2 tbsp oyster sauce</li><li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li><li>1 tbsp rice vinegar (optional, for brightness)</li><li>1 tsp sesame oil</li><li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li><li>1 tbsp cornstarch (for sauce)</li><li>1/4 cup water (for cornstarch slurry)</li><li>2-3 green onions, chopped (for garnish)</li><li>Sesame seeds (for garnish)</li></ul><h3>Instructions</h3><ol><li>In a bowl, toss the cut chicken pieces with 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 1 teaspoon cornstarch. Set aside for at least 10 minutes while you prepare other ingredients.</li><li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook according to package directions until al dente. Drain well and set aside. You can toss with a tiny bit of oil to prevent sticking if desired.</li><li>In a small bowl, whisk together the 1/4 cup soy sauce, oyster sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar (if using), sesame oil, and chicken broth. In a separate tiny bowl, whisk 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 1/4 cup water to create a slurry; set aside.</li><li>Heat 2 tablespoons of neutral oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken in a single layer and cook for 3-4 minutes per side, until golden brown and cooked through. Remove chicken from the pan and set aside.</li><li>Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the same pan (reduce heat to medium if needed). Add the minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.</li><li>Pour the prepared sauce mixture into the pan with the garlic. Bring to a gentle simmer. Whisk the cornstarch slurry one more time, then slowly pour it into the simmering sauce, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency.</li><li>Return the cooked chicken and drained noodles to the pan with the thickened sauce. Toss everything together vigorously until the noodles and chicken are thoroughly coated in the sauce.</li><li>Serve immediately, garnished generously with chopped green onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Enjoy your delicious homemade Chicken Garlic Noodles!</li></ol></div>
